# SMC Fair Value Gap (FVG) / Imbalance

## Concept
Fair value gaps are imbalanced areas where price moves so fast that it leaves 
a gap between candles 1 and 3 in a three-candle pattern. 
Price often returns to these zones to rebalance before continuing.

## Ideal Context
- Strong impulsive move with clear imbalance.
- HTF direction aligned with the impulsive move.
- Clean FVG zone, not fully filled yet.

## Entry Rules
- Identify FVG using the three-candle pattern: candle 2 creates displacement.
- Mark the FVG zone boundaries.
- Wait for price to retrace into the FVG in the direction of the original displacement.
- Look for rejection or lower timeframe confirmation (e.g., micro BOS).

## Stop Loss Rules
- SL beyond the FVG zone:
  - For bullish FVG: below the FVG or origin order block.
  - For bearish FVG: above the FVG or origin order block.
- Avoid trading tiny FVGs inside chop.

## Take Profit Rules
- First TP at recent swing high/low in direction of the move.
- Further TP at next structure level or opposing liquidity.
- Consider trailing SL if trend is strongly aligned on HTF.

## Common Mistakes
- Forcing FVG trades during consolidation.
- Entering without confluence from HTF bias.
