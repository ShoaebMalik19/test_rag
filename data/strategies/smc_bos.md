# SMC Break of Structure (BOS)

## Concept
Break of structure (BOS) confirms a change in directional bias. 
A bullish BOS occurs when price closes above a previous significant swing high.
A bearish BOS occurs when price closes below a previous significant swing low.

## Ideal Context
- Clear trend or range structure
- Clean swing highs and lows
- No messy chop around the level

## Entry Rules
- Identify a meaningful swing high/low (not random noise).
- Wait for a full body candle close beyond the level to confirm BOS.
- Wait for price to retrace back to the broken level, an order block, or a refined demand/supply zone.
- Look for confirmation: rejection wick, engulfing candle, or lower timeframe structure shift.

## Stop Loss Rules
- SL goes beyond the invalidation point:
  - For bullish BOS: below the demand zone or swing low.
  - For bearish BOS: above the supply zone or swing high.
- Keep risk per trade within 0.5%–1% of account if possible.

## Take Profit Rules
- First TP at next internal liquidity (equal highs/lows, minor structure).
- Second TP at external liquidity or major HTF level.
- Optionally trail stop behind new higher lows/lower highs as trend develops.

## Common Mistakes
- Entering on the first break without waiting for a retest.
- Using BOS on tiny swing points that don’t matter on higher timeframe.
