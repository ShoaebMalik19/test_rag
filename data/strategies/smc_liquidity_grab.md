# SMC Liquidity Grab (Stop Hunt / Sweep)

## Concept
Liquidity grab happens when price runs above equal highs or below equal lows, 
captures stop losses and pending orders, then quickly reverses.

## Ideal Context
- Equal highs or equal lows with obvious retail stop placement.
- HTF level nearby (daily/4H supply or demand).
- Fast spike through the level followed by immediate rejection.

## Entry Rules
- Mark liquidity pools: equal highs, equal lows, trendline liquidity.
- Wait for price to run through the level and form a wick/sweep.
- Enter in the opposite direction once price closes back inside the range or leaves a strong reversal candle.
- Confirmation from lower timeframe BOS adds confluence.

## Stop Loss Rules
- SL goes beyond the sweep wick (above for shorts, below for longs).
- If sweep wick is very long, reduce lot size to keep risk % controlled.

## Take Profit Rules
- First TP at mid-range or origin of the impulsive move.
- Further TPs at next liquidity pool or HTF structure level.
- Move SL to breakeven once price leaves the swept zone decisively.

## Common Mistakes
- Entering before the sweep completes.
- Fighting strong clean trends where “liquidity grabs” keep failing.
